In this challenge, i created a python script to analyse the financial record of a company. Using a set of financial data called budget_data.csv i was able to analyze th records to calculate the following:
 - The total number of months included in the dataset
 - The net total amount of "profit/losses" over the entire period
 - The average of changes in "profit/losses" over the entire period
 - The greatest increase in profit (date and amount) over the entire period
 - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the enntire period
 
Also, i was give a poll data called electection_data.csv, to help a small rural town modernizes vote-counting process. I created a python script that analyzes votes and calculates the following:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candiadte won
- The winner of the election based on popular votes

This python script  works for each datset provided.
